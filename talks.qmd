I frequently deliver talks at analytics meet ups and organizations throughout the Midwest. These are a sample of some of the presentations I've given in the last few years.

## [Science & Bullshit: <br> What We Can't Not Know in the Age of AI](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/blob/main/science_and_bullshit.pdf)

The technology landscape is full of solutions purporting to use artificial intelligence to offer insights and solve problems. Many of these claims exploit the hype surrounding the term AI: "if AI can do X, AI can do Y". 

Data science and machine learning can be a tremendous help to organizations, but how do we separate *science* from *bull$#@!*? 

In this talk, I argue that one does not need to be a data scientist to question claims made in the language of math and statistics. I discuss the knowledge we must have and questions we must ask in the age of AI.

## [Now What? <br> Model Building, Science, and Analytics](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/blob/main/now_what_symposium.pdf)

Organizations increasingly speak about being data-driven, but should this be our goal? In this talk I discuss philosophy of science and how we learn from data. I then illustrate the process of building predictive models with some of my own side projects: board games and minor league hockey.

Data science is on the roadmap for many organizations and businesses. What exactly is data science? What can it do? What can it not do?

I've given a lot of talks as a professor and as a consultant. This a compilation of advice and lessons I've picked up over the years from giving talks. Massively inspired by a presentation my advisor gave in grad school.
