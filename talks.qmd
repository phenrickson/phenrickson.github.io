I frequently deliver talks at analytics meet ups and organizations throughout the Midwest. These are a sample of some of the presentations I've given in the last few years.

## [The Curse of Knowledge: What Do They Mean When They Say AI?](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/raw/main/the-curse-of-knowledge.pdf)

A data scientist has joined a team of cybersecurity experts. He knows next to nothing about cybersecurity. But the world of cybersecurity is suddenly fixated on artificial intelligence. Every cybersecurity vendor is talking about their new AI-powered capabilities. 

A data scientist wants to tell you, what do they really mean when they say AI?

## [The Data You Don't Have:  <br> Where is the Value in Data Science?](https://phenrickson.github.io/data-you-dont-have/presentation.html#/title-slide)

Most organizations want to advance their capabilities in data science/machine learning/artificial intelligence. At the same, most organizations struggle to find value from them.

In this talk, I tell two stories of "old-fashioned" science with data and what we can learn from them.

## [Science & Bullshit: <br> What We Can't Not Know in the Age of AI](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/raw/main/science_and_bullshit.pdf)

The technology landscape is full of solutions purporting to use artificial intelligence to offer insights and solve problems. Many of these claims exploit the hype surrounding the term AI: "if AI can do X, AI can do Y". 

Data science and machine learning can be a tremendous help to organizations, but how do we separate *science* from *bull$#@!*? 

In this talk, I argue that one does not need to be a data scientist to question claims made in the language of math and statistics. I discuss the knowledge we must have and questions we must ask in the age of AI.

## [Now What? <br> Model Building, Science, and Analytics](https://github.com/phenrickson/talks/raw/main/now_what_symposium.pdf)

Organizations increasingly speak about being data-driven, but should this be our goal? In this talk I discuss philosophy of science and how we learn from data. I then illustrate the process of building predictive models with some of my own side projects: board games and minor league hockey.

Data science is on the roadmap for many organizations and businesses. What exactly is data science? What can it do? What can it not do?

I've given a lot of talks as a professor and as a consultant. This a compilation of advice and lessons I've picked up over the years from giving talks. Massively inspired by a presentation my advisor gave in grad school.
