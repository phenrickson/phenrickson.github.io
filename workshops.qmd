## What They Didn't Teach You About Data Science

I made the jump from academic research to consuling and have learned many (painful) lessons along the way about working on data science projects.

This workshop focuses on enabling ccollaborative open-source data science development. The goal is to create consistent, repeatable patterns for data science project development, iteration, and delivery.

Learning a little bit about version control package/environment management, and pipelines goes a long way towards solving the headaches of modern data science projects.
