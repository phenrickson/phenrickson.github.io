    "text": "There are some CFB projects I’ve worked on using data from collegefootballdata.com.\nDisclaimer: Despite spending more years at Florida State (and being on campus for the 2013 championship season) while I worked on my PhD, my own college football loyalties lie with my undergraduate university, Texas A&M.\n\n\nSimulating College Football Seasons\n\n \n\nWhich teams are most likely to win their conference? Make the playoff? Win the national championship?\n\n2022\nBowl Predictions\nTeam Predictions // Game Predictions\nTeam Profile Examples\nFlorida State // Wisconsin\nI simulate the remainder of the college football season 1000 times after every week of the regular season. These simulations come from an (adjusted) Elo model that I developed using historical game and play by data - the current iteration of the model uses historical game outcomes, team offensive and defensive efficiency metrics, and recruiting composites in order to estimate a team’s relative rating compared to other teams.\n\n\n2021\nTeam Predictions as of Week 14 // Game Predictions as of Week 14\nTeam Predictions as of Week 9 // Game Predictions as of Week 9\nTeam Predictions as of Week 5 // Game Predictions as of Week 5\nTeam Predictions as of Week 0 // Game Predictions as of Week 0\n\n\n2019\nTeam Predictions as of Week 14 // Game Predictions as of Week 14\nTeam Predictions as of Week 9 // Game Predictions as of Week 9\nTeam Predictions as of Week 5 // Game Predictions as of Week 5\nTeam Predictions as of Week 0 // Game Predictions as of Week 0\n\n\n\nExpected Points and Efficiency\n\n \n\nHow valuable is a 3 yard gain on 1st and 10 compared to a 3 yard gain on 3rd and 2? How good a is a team’s offense or defense relative to other teams? How efficient is a team when passing the ball on third downs?\nTo answer questions like these, I develop and explore an expected points model at the play level for evaluating college football offenses and defenses. The goal of this analysis is to place a value on offensive/defensive plays in terms of their contribution’s to a team’s expected points.\nI train a multinomial logistic regression on the next scoring event for each play (TD, FG, Opp. TD, Opp. FG, etc) as a function of the situation in the game (down, distance, yards to goal). I use the probabilities from this model to compute expected points at the play level, which I then aggregate to the team, game, and season level in order to measure each team’s raw offensive/defensive efficiency.\nI then adjust each team’s raw efficiency metrics based on the quality of their opponents via a ridge regression in order to obtain opponent adjusted offensive/defensive efficiency metrics for every team. I plot these at the season level to examine a how a team’s offense/defense has changed since 2007.\n\n\nMethodology\nExpected Points Methodology\nExamining Individual Plays via Expected Points\nOpponent Adjusted Expected Points"

Many of these claims exploit the hype surrounding the term AI: “if AI can do X, AI can do Y”.\nData science and machine learning can be a tremendous help to organizations, but how do we separate science from bull$#@!?\nIn this talk, I argue that one does not need to be a data scientist to question claims made in the language of math and statistics. I discuss the knowledge we must have and questions we must ask in the age of AI."

I am not the first to develop the method for computing these ratings, which is a very simple statistical model, but I do use that method to keep a list of up-to-date complexity ratings based on my latest pull of games from BGG. Second, I amend the formula for the geek rating to place a greater weight on the popularity of the game, which I have found can mitigate a tendency of the geek ratings to skew towards the ‘the hotness’."
